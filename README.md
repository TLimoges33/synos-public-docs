## What is Syn_OS?

**Syn_OS** (Synaptic Operating System) is a **production-grade cybersecurity platform** built on Debian 13 Trixie that bridges the gap between cutting-edge security research and practical penetration testing.

### Why "Syn_OS"?

The underscore "_" represents the **synaptic gap** — the space between neurons where signals jump. Syn_OS bridges the gap between:
- **Traditional Security** ↔ **AI-Enhanced Defense**
- **Theory** ↔ **Practice**
- **Learning** ↔ **Execution**

> *"Own Your Infrastructure. Own Your Intelligence. Own Your Future."*
